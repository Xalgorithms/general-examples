Two samples "offers to purchase" real property are provided from Singapore. In order to create some hypothetical cases for 
testing, we can treat them as globally-relevant sample templates and adjust as we learn of additional or differen info 
required on other jurisdicions. 

Details on Singapore's unique National Registration Identity Card (NRIC), which is needed on any "offer to purchase" real property can be found here:
