/* Assume http://www.aquip-petrole.com/ hosts an app for managers of gas stations to register to have Lichen automate the gas tax reduction. Their registration app publishes the table to the Internet of Rules. */
Why would you want to have this table? Some sort of authorative source of truth? Otherwise, the proprieter could just supply a location code in the invoice...  But, that doesn't answer why there's a table supplied by "someone" or "some agency". That might be considered "where the transaction" took place, not where the property IS...
The problem is, the legislation is not based on location per se, but on distance by a common route (I can't locate the detailed tax interpretation at this time). So it is too complex to be determined by the algorithm from knowing an OLC (Open Location Code) -- the rule could use the GoogleMaps API or similar GPS service, but for now I think that's too much work for "the rule author". Therefore the IoR must leave this matter in the hands of the rule owner and/or in the hands of the rule beneficiary to sort out. (Also, if the gas station owners listing their distance 'exaggerate', that can be deemed tax fraud. That's for them and the province to deal with, not the rule author or the IoR.) My working solution is to imagine gas stations registering for this tax reduction -- they probably have to anyways otherwise their numbers would look wrong to the tax authorities. 
Who maintains the table?  See http://www.aquip-petrole.com/   It could be them, as the industry association, or the Gov Quebec. Both approaches would make sense.
