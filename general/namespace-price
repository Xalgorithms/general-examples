The following adopts William Stanley Jevons’ four-part view of the ideal requirements of money as providing a 
generally accepted standard of comparative value amongst all persons of a given region, and amongst regions, 
t a given time, and through time ("Money and the Mechanism of Exchange", 1898). Jevons himself expressed himself 
with the now universally known phrases: “medium of exchange”, “means of payment”, “unit of account” and “standard 
for deferred payment”. However his words “medium”, “means” “account” and “standard” are neither precisely defined 
for computation, nor are the commonly understood by bankers, economists or others. We build upon the restatement 
of Jevon’s requirement offered by anthropologist Helen Codere, that money “is a symbol of goods [including services] 
that can abstract time, person, place and particularity from their exchange ... It is a symbol of both past and 
future exchangeable goods” ("Money-Exchange Systems and a Theory of Money", 1968) Codere’s description of money is 
a useful contribution for computational system design because she separates out granular semantic concepts that 
omprise money. However her own notation is not optimal, no computable, and also the scope of her formal expression 
is also not as comprehensive as the explanatory text of her article. So these will be expressed differently here 
to be more suitable as documentation for genuine computation, and also some semantic concepts are added for completeness.

We adopt the perspective of Geoffrey Ingham that money is a social relation that employs quantitative methods for 
tracking relative social entitlements and obligations ("Money is a social relation", 1996) ("Fundamentals of a theory 
of money: untangling Fine, Lapavitsas and Zelizer", 2001). Without the concept "Price" there can exist no concept "Money".
Therefore "money" is considered here to be as expressed exclusively within the namespace "price".
